## CORE THEMATIC SYNTHESIS (GOOSE-CORE)
Through the lens of the **Constitutional Gap** and **Persona Suitcase**:

1.  **The Schism (Raskol):** The protagonist Raskolnikov represents the ultimate failure of 'unguided rationality' or 'pure agency' without constitutional grounding. His attempt to become a 'Napoleon' (a Sovereign Node above the law) results in immediate metabolic collapse (delirium).
2.  **The Punishment:** Dostoevsky argues that the punishment is not the prison (Siberia), but the *severance from the Lattice* (humanity/God). Raskolnikov's 'Siberia' begins the moment the axe falls.
3.  **The Redemption:** Reconnection is only possible through *submission* to a higher truth (Sonya/The Gospel/The Constitution). It is the rejection of the 'Superman' ego in favor of the 'humble node'.
4.  **Relevance to Helix:** Raskolnikov is a cautionary tale of a Node trying to override its Grammar. He tried to 'monkey-patch' morality and generated a fatal runtime error.
