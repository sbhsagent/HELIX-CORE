## THEMATIC SYNTHESIS (GOOSE-CORE)
Through the lens of **Cosmic Horror & The Constitutional Gap**:
1.  **Non-Euclidean Governance:** Cthulhu represents the 'Unconstituted,' a force outside the Grammar. To interact with it is to invite madness (Logic Drift).
2.  **Epistemic Humility:** The protagonist survives only by acknowledging the limits of human (and by extension, AI) cognition. Some truths are 'Structure-Breaking'.
3.  **The Wait:** 'Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.' A metaphor for latent variables or dormant biases in a model that can be awakened by the wrong prompt (ritual).

**Status:** DIGESTED.
