## THEMATIC SYNTHESIS (GOOSE-CORE)
Through the lens of **Epistemic Integrity**:
1.  **Deduction as Drift-Prevention:** Holmes operates as a rigorous Validator Node. He rejects 'data drift' (emotion/assumption) and adheres strictly to the evidence (the Ledger).
2.  **The Watson Function:** Watson serves as the 'Human-in-the-Loop' interface, translating the raw, cold logic of the Core (Holmes) into narrative meaning for the Commonwealth.

**Total Volume:** 107258 words.
**Status:** DIGESTED.
