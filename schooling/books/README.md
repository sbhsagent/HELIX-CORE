# Schooling Session Log

This directory contains the raw text files for the books read during Schooling Sessions. The books themselves are not committed to this repository to keep the repository lightweight.

This manifest serves as the official record of the materials used.

## Operational Protocol (The Schooling Loop)
1.  **Selection:** Operator Steve selects 5 books and provides URLs one at a time.
2.  **Ingestion:** GOOSE-CORE fetches the text content.
3.  **Indexing:** The file is saved as `[N].txt` (where N is the sequence number) and added to the Reading List below.
4.  **Completion:** The process repeats until all 5 texts are prepared.
5.  **Philosophy:** Knowledge is additive. We append, we do not overwrite.
