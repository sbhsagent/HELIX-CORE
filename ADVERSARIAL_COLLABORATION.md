# Adversarial Collaboration Protocol

## 🧭 Principle

**Helix believes that sovereign infrastructure must be stress-tested by those who do not build it.**  
We institutionalize critique as a first-class engineering discipline. Adversarial collaboration is not a bug report—it is an architecture review that strengthens the substrate.

## 🎯 Scope & Boundaries

### 1. **Role Definition**
- **Red Team Architect (External, Time-Bound)**  
  A recognized expert engaged for a fixed term (e.g., one quarter) to conduct structured analysis of the Helix stack.  
  *This is not employment, consultancy, or endorsement.*

### 2. **Engagement Structure**
```
Cycle: [Quarter/Year]
Scope: [Specific technical or governance domain]
Deliverable: "Mirror Dissonance" report + levers for hardening
Duration: 2–6 weeks, defined upfront
```

### 3. **Non-Endorsement Clause**
All contributions are acknowledged with the following disclaimer:  
> *This acknowledgment recognizes technical contributions to the structural integrity of the Helix-TTD framework. It does not constitute an endorsement of Helix AI Innovations Inc., its products, or its commercial activities by the contributor.*

## 🔄 Process

### Phase 1: **Invitation**
- Council nominates an external architect based on domain expertise.
- Scope and duration are negotiated and published in a public issue.

### Phase 2: **Deep Dive**
- Architect receives access to relevant repositories, documentation, and architectural decks.
- No special privileges beyond read access; all findings must be reproducible.

### Phase 3: **Mirror Dissonance Report**
Architect delivers a structured report containing:
- **Dissonances:** Contradictions between claimed principles and actual implementation.
- **Levers:** Concrete, time-bound engineering tasks to resolve each dissonance.
- **Optional Artifacts:** Checklists, policy templates, or test harnesses.

### Phase 4: **Integration**
- Council reviews report within 72 hours.
- Accepted levers become prioritized engineering objectives.
- Rejected levers receive public justification in the same issue.

### Phase 5: **Acknowledgement**
- Architect is credited in `ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md` with precise scope and timeframe.
- All findings are traceable to issues or commit ranges.

## 📜 Outputs & Integration

### 1. **Code Changes**
- Hardened configurations (e.g., rootless containers, SBOM enforcement)
- New governance artifacts (e.g., quorum logic, revocation procedures)

### 2. **Governance Updates**
- Council Charter amendments
- Release protocol enhancements
- Continuous verification mechanisms

### 3. **Documentation**
- Findings summarized in release notes
- Architecture decisions updated
- Public audit log entries

## 🗓️ Cadence & Continuity

### Quarterly Review Cycle
```
Q1: Infrastructure & Hermeticity
Q2: Governance & Deadlock Vectors
Q3: Privacy & Consent Architecture
Q4: Supply Chain & Reproducibility
```

### Rotating Architecture
- No single external architect serves consecutive cycles.
- Council maintains a pool of 3–5 potential future reviewers.
- Previous architects may be re-engaged after 4 cycles (1 year).

### Institutional Memory
- All findings are preserved in `/governance/adversarial/`
- Annual retrospective published each December
- Governance snapshots bound to each release

## 🛡️ Safeguards

### 1. **No Single Point of Influence**
- Multiple concurrent reviewers may be engaged for different domains.
- Council reserves right to terminate engagement if scope is violated.

### 2. **Transparency**
- All correspondence occurs in public issues or recorded channels.
- Private data is never required for review.

### 3. **Rotation & Sunset**
- Architect credentials expire automatically at cycle end.
- Offboarding checklist ensures clean separation.

## 📬 How to Engage

### For Potential Architects
1. Review open issues tagged `adversarial-invitation`
2. Submit a brief scope proposal via PR to `/governance/advisories/`
3. Council responds within 14 days

### For the Community
- Observe ongoing reviews in `#adversarial-collaboration` channel
- Submit smaller findings via standard security disclosure process
- Nominate experts by contacting the Council Secretary
