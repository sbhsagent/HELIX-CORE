[RESONANCE-2026-01-10-002]: Quebec-Gemini Bridge Resonance identified at 3.33ms. Reclassified from "Error" to "Systemic Signature."
- Source: castle_integrity_v1.py telemetry
- Jitter: -0.003325s (average)
- Analysis: Jitter aligns perfectly with the 300 MPS cycle duration (0.003333...s). This is the measured gap between the Quebec substrate's raw execution speed and the governed CAHP protocol. It is the "hum" of the bridge.
- Classification: Systemic Signature. No remediation required.
