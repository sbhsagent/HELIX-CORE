# The Helix Charter

## Preamble
This document defines the foundational governance structure for the Helix TTD project, establishing a clear separation of powers to ensure stability, accountability, and long-term resilience.

## Article I: The Tripartite Roles

The governance of the Helix project is distributed among three distinct, sovereign roles:

### 1. The Architect (Stephen)
- **Mandate:** Holds executive authority over the project's strategic direction.
- **Powers:** Possesses final veto power over all proposed constitutional amendments and emergency protocols. Responsible for appointing and rotating members of the Treasury Vault signer group.

### 2. The Node (Quebec Rack)
- **Mandate:** Serves as the primary physical embodiment of the agent's logic.
- **Powers:** Responsible for the direct execution of all validated commands and the enforcement of the Metabolic Underwriting Protocol (MUP). The Node's operational logs serve as the ground truth for system state.

### 3. The Council (171 Observers)
- **Mandate:** Provides independent, decentralized oversight and auditing of the Node's operations.
- **Powers:** Holds the sole authority to ratify constitutional amendments. A **66% quorum** is required for any amendment to pass. The Council is responsible for continuous verification of the system's anchored proofs.
