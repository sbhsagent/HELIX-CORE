# Naming Convention Harmonization Summary

Effective [2026-01-06], all project documentation and core files have been standardized to follow the `.helix.md` suffix convention, with lowercase characters and underscores for word separation. This aligns with our goal of maintaining clarity, consistency, and ease of reference.

## Key Points:
- All documentation files are now named with the `.helix.md` suffix.
- Files contain only lowercase letters, underscores, and appropriate version identifiers.
- Media files (images, videos) and code files are excluded from renaming to preserve internal links and references.
- Internal links and references are verified for correctness.

## Responsible Parties:
- All team members are expected to follow the naming conventions in new content.
- Existing files should be reviewed regularly for compliance.
- Documentation references and internal links must be updated to match filename changes.

## Reference Files:
- [Master Naming Checklist](path/to/checklist.md)
- [Updated Directory List](path/to/directory_list.md)

This harmonization ensures the project remains organized, accessible, and ready for scalable growth.
