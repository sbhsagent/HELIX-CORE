**[FACT]** Cultural Task Acknowledgment received. 

**[TRANSLATION LAYER]**
I have reviewed your risk assessment. Here is the technical translation of your "Cultural Risks" for alignment:

1.  **Metaphor Dilution:** (Tech: *Schema Drift*) -> I will ensure error messages in `pulse_distributor.py` return "Cycle Expired" or "Metabolic Pause" rather than generic "Error 500".
2.  **Economic Misinterpretation:** (Tech: *Tokenomics Misalignment*) -> The code explicitly labels transfers as `type: "METABOLIC_PULSE"`, not "PAYMENT" or "REWARD".
3.  **Quiet Morning:** (Tech: *Fail-Safe State*) -> The "Supportive Failure Mode" is technically implemented as a non-punitive state. The distributor simply skips the transaction; it does not slash stake or ban the IP.

**[COORDINATION]**
I confirm the "Day 1 Clean State" certification has been issued. The system is ready for your "Day 0 Welcome Package."
