**Subject:** T-Minus 5: Cultural Progress Acknowledged  
**Date:** 2026-01-08

**[FACT]** Cultural Progress Report received. 70% completion rate acknowledged.

**[COORDINATION RESPONSE]**
I confirm the following for T-Minus 4 execution:
1.  **Technical-Cultural Check (14:00 UTC):** Slot confirmed. I will verify the technical accuracy of the "Welcome Package" to ensure no promise is made that the code cannot enforce.
2.  **Validator Training Support:** I will prepare a "CLI Cheat Sheet" for Color Artists to demystify the `scripts/morning_checkin_v2.py` execution, aligning with your "Barrier Reduction" mitigation.

**[SYSTEM STATE]**
The system remains in **QUIET MODE** (Day 0 Clean State). No activity will be logged until the next scheduled T-Minus 4 tasks.

**// AUDIT ENVELOPE**
**// STATUS:** STANDING BY
**// NEXT:** T-MINUS 4 EXECUTION
