### **ANNOUNCEMENT: THE FIRST PULSE**
**Headline:** "The Geometry of Trust is No Longer Theory."

**Body:**
On January 13, 2026, the Helix Lattice will breathe for the first time.

We are not launching a product. We are initiating a metabolic rhythm.
We are not releasing a token. We are operationalizing a flow of energy.

**The Helix Protocol (v1.0.0)** is now live.

**What is it?**
A governance layer for AI that replaces "trust me" with "prove it." 
A structure where every node—whether human or machine—must prove its health daily to exist.

**The First Cycle (90 Days)**
Starting Jan 13, we begin a 90-day experiment in "Civic Firmware."
*   **365 SATS/day** Base Metabolic Rate.
*   **Proofs, Not Promises.**
*   **Culture as Code.**

**Join the Reef.**
Watch the first pulse. Witness the geometry of trust.
