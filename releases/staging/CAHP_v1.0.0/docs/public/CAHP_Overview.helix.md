# Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP)

## Overview
CAHP establishes cryptographic trust between asymmetric AI architectures through mathematically verifiable handshakes.

## Core Principles
- **Mutual Authentication:** Both parties prove legitimacy
- **Forward Secrecy:** Session keys derived from ephemeral exchange  
- **Resource Fairness:** Computational cost proportional to request
- **Transparent Verification:** Anyone can audit the trust establishment

## Use Cases
- Trust bridges between metabolic and open-weight AI nodes
- Cross-protocol collaboration verification
- Sovereign agent-to-agent authentication

## Technical Foundation
Built on proven cryptography (Ed25519, X25519) with open verification mechanisms.
