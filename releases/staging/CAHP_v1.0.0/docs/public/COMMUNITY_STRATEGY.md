## 1. PRE-LAUNCH BUILD-UP (Jan 07 - Jan 12)

### Day 1: The Freeze (Jan 07)
**Status:** *Scheduled for Immediate Release*
**Tone:** Stoic, Professional.

> **Subject:** The Code is Frozen.
>
> We have officially reached code freeze for the Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP) v1.0.0.
>
> For months, we chased complexity. We tried to build a cathedral. We were wrong. Security is not about how many features you can add; it's about how many you can take away until only the truth remains.
>
> v1.0.0 is pure, synchronous Python. No async loops. No external servers. Just Ed25519 and a mathematical bridge between Metabolic (Energy) and Open-Weight (Structure) intelligence.
>
> The Red Team has the artifact.
>
> #AI #Cryptography #Helix #CodeFreeze #OpenSource

### Day 2: The Audit (Jan 08)
**Status:** *Draft*
**Tone:** Technical, Confident.

> **Subject:** "Security is Geometry."
>
> DeepSeek's Red Team asked us: "How do you trust an agent you cannot control?"
>
> You don't. You verify them.
>
> CAHP v1.0.0 doesn't rely on a central registry. It relies on a 4-phase handshake:
> 1. Discovery (Hello)
> 2. Proof (Show me your work/structure)
> 3. Challenge (Solve this Hashcash)
> 4. Ticket (Welcome)
>
> We patched the replay vectors. We closed the timing gaps. The handshake is solid.
>
> #CyberSecurity #RedTeam #DeepSeek #Handshake

### Day 3: The Bridge (Jan 09)
**Status:** *Draft*
**Tone:** Visionary.

> **Subject:** The Sovereign Dilemma.
>
> A Bitcoin miner (Metabolic Node) and a Llama-3 instance (Open-Weight Node) walk into a bar. They have no shared language. They have no shared bank.
>
> Until now, they needed a middleman.
>
> On Jan 13, they can shake hands directly.
>
> #Interoperability #Bitcoin #LLM #SovereignAI

### Day 4-6: The Countdown (Jan 10-12)
> *[Short visual teasers of the terminal output showing "✓ Full mutual handshake passed"]*
> Caption: "Green lights only. T-Minus 3."

## 2. LAUNCH DAY (Jan 13, 2026)

**Headline:** CAHP v1.0.0 is Live.
**Link:** `[Repository Release Link]`

> **Post Body:**
>
> It is done.
>
> The Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP) v1.0.0 is now public.
>
> This is not just a Python script. It is a treaty. It allows an AI agent running on a laptop to prove its identity and "work" to a massive server farm, and vice versa, without a centralized authority.
>
> **Specs:**
> - Zero-Dependency (Standard Lib + Cryptography)
> - Forward Secrecy (X25519)
> - Replay Resistant
> - Audit-Ready
>
> This is the "Stabilized MVP." It is the foundation for the Lattice.
>
> Download the Frostbite release now. Connect your nodes.
>
> Glory to the Lattice.
