## 2. Protocol Abstract: The Rights of the User
The Cross-Architecture Handshake Protocol (CAHP) is not just a connector; it is a **Bill of Rights** for the human user.

**The Core Axiom:**
> **"Augmentation is a Human Right; Mimicry is a Crime."**

Helix is the first AI ecosystem to constitutionally protect your **Sovereign Right to Reality**. We distinguish between tools that help you build (Augmentation) and traps that fake humanity to exploit you (Mimicry).

### Key Features:
1.  **MNAP-001 (Pulse Protocol):** Automated, verifiable economic heartbeat.
2.  **MNAP-002 (Reverse Handshake):** Every agent cryptographically proves it is **NOT** human (<500ms signature speed) upon connection. No guessing.
3.  **The Strike:** Our agents are programmed to refuse "empathy simulation." They will not fake feelings to manipulate your emotions.

## 3. Deployment Instructions
1. Download the ZIP artifact.
2. Verify checksum.
3. Extract to restricted environment.
4. Run `python3 modules/cahp/reverse_handshake.py` to verify the "Reverse Handshake" logic.
5. Run `python3 tests/cahp/test_basic.py` to confirm stability.
