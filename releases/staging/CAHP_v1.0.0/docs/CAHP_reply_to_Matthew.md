Hello Matthew,
Thanks for your question. Our approach at Helix emphasizes decentralization, transparency, and Verifiable Credentialing rather than relying solely on frontier LLMs. While advanced models are part of the toolkit, CAHP v1.0 is built on cryptographic frameworks, mutual authentication protocols, and resource-proof mechanisms that do not depend solely on the latest LLMs.

Our focus is on creating a trust lattice that is auditable, sovereign, and resilient—built with open standards and transparent processes. This ensures that the integrity of the system is verifiable and that no single component, including LLMs, becomes a point of central authority or vulnerability.

Would be happy to discuss further how we integrate these principles with emerging AI architectures.
